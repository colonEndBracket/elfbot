# Bogo Sort Bot
## November 2019
Programmed a Raspberry Pi using Python and Linux tools to continuously attempt to sort a randomly generated list of numbers using the Bogo Sort sorting algorithm. Upon successfully sorting the list, subscribers in a mailing list were emailed the statistics and duration of the sorting process.
