    "Raspberry Pi Robot Arm Surveillance Camera (November 2018)":"Programmed a Raspberry Pi that controlled a web camera mounted on a servo-motor robot arm. Implemented the ability to view a live feed, capture images, record video and control the servo arm over SSH",
    "Personal Website (May 2020)":"Registered a domain name and set up a personal website to showcase my projects and any future projects in the form of blog posts.",
    "Proxmox Virtualization Environment Host Node (February 2020)":"Installed the Proxmox VE operating system onto a desktop computer to act as a host node. Created LXC (Linux container) templates. Utilized containers to host web servers, Linux shells for friends, Discord chat bots, and Minecraft servers.",
    "RFID Card Attendance Scanner (December 2019)":"Developed a C program for a Texas Instruments TIVA LaunchPad Embedded Systems Board to interface with an RFID Card Reader to take attendance by scanning student ID cards. Implemented python script to send attendance list email.",
    "Arduino Digital Clock (December 2019)":"Programmed an Arduino to display the four digits of a digital clock onto a four-digit seven segment display. Implemented a circuit of two pushbuttons to be able to adjust the time by incrementing or decrementing the value due to the lack of a hardware clock and internet access to access an internet clock.",
    "Bogo Sort Bot (November 2019)":"Programmed a Raspberry Pi using Python and Linux tools to continuously attempt to sort a randomly generated list of numbers using the Bogo Sort sorting algorithm. Upon successfully sorting the list, subscribers in a mailing list were emailed the statistics and duration of the sorting process.",
