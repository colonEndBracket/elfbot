# Arduino Digital Clock
## December 2019
Programmed an Arduino to display the four digits of a digital clock onto a four-digit seven segment display. Implemented a circuit of two pushbuttons to be able to adjust the time by incrementing or decrementing the value due to the lack of a hardware clock and internet access to access an internet clock.
